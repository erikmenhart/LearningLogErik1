Things I learnt...

  I learnt a basic overview as well as some more complex facts and parts about storage, I learnt how they connect how they work
as well as the different types and their respective pros and cons. I came out of this project with a much deeper understanding
of the number systems used by computers. I am now able to give a brief explanation of how they work and why they're used.

Things I still want to learn...

  I want to be able to fluidly speak about the computer parts that we learned and be perhaps able to make a career out of
understanding. Aswell, I want to be able to understand the number systems and be able to apply them to the work that I do both 
in school and out of school.
